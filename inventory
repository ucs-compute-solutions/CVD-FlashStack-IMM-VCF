# Currently, this file does not need any server entries to be populated.
# You can execute update_all_inventory.yml playbook to update your server information in this file.
# However, this server information will be used in future to deploy Server Profiles.
# In the current release, the playbooks are used to create server profile template from which
# server profiles are derived manually by the end user
